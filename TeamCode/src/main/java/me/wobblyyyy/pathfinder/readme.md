# Working with Pathfinder
There's a couple things you need to know about working with Pathfinder. All of this (should) be well-documented via the
official Pathfinder docs, however, I want to reiterate what's going on here for the purpose of clarity.

- All angle measures are in radians. If you don't know how radians work, you can use the "toRadians" method in the
Geometry class, or the "toRadians" method in the Math class - your choice.
