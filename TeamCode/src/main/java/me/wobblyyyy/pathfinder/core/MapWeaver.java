/**
 * Mathematical utilities used in connecting PathfinderCore implementations and our
 * very own core implementations.
 *
 * <p>
 * PathfindingCore and this library are entirely different and use equally different
 * methods of storing geometrical data - as a result, we need to convert stuff.
 * MapWeaver.java to the rescue!
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * I'm not entirely sure how much processing power this requires to run. I'm just going
 * to pre-emptively suggest that this be run on a more powerful computer (not a robotics
 * phone, I can't say they're very powerful) and then data files from the more powerful
 * computer are transferred over to the significantly less powerful one.
