/**
 * A collection of code related to localizing the odometry functionality of the
 * Pathfinder library.
 *
 * <p>
 * Natively, odometry is a pretty rough subject to get into. This package is designed
 * to (hopefully) help resolve any issues you may face with odometry.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you're using Pathfinder for the First Tech Challenge, go do yourself a favor and
 * download Pathfinder-ftc instead of Pathfinder. It's much more useful for FTC-related
 * programming and includes Pathfinder, so you don't have to worry about missing out
 * on anything at all.
 * </p>
