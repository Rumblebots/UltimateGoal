# Setting up phone configuration
Phone configuration is dependent on several things, including
1. Case-specific names of hardware components.
2. Exact placement of plugged-in hardware components.

Failure to follow both of these as listed in this document may cause the robot to not function either as intended or at all.
## Names of Hardware Components
The names of all of the hardware components involved with Team 11253's SKYSTONE 2019-2020 robot are listed here, and are as follow. Please note that they should be entered in to the phone exactly as they appear here.
### Drive Motors
<code>Neverest Orbital 20 // FrontRight</code> the front-facing, right-side motor on the robot.
<code>Neverest Orbital 20 // FrontLeft</code> the front-facing, left-side motor on the robot.
<code>Neverest Orbital 20 // BackRight</code> the back-facing, right-side motor on the robot.
<code>Neverest Orbital 20 // BackLeft</code> the back-facing, left-side motor on the robot.
### Auxiliary Motors
<code>REV HD Core Hex Motor // stackerVertical1</code> can be swapped with stackerVertical2. on the side of the robot.
<code>REV HD Core Hex Motor // stackerVertical2</code> can be swapped with stackerVertical1. on the side of the robot.
<code>Neverest Orbital 20 // intakeRight</code> can be swapped with intakeLeft, although this should be avoided if at all possible. these are the controlling forces behind the large green wheels near the intake.
<code>Neverest Orbital 20 // intakeLeft</code> can be swapped with intakeRight, although this should be avoided if at all possible. these are the controlling forces behind the large green wheels near the intake.
### Servos
<code>Continuous Rotation Servo // intakeServoRight</code> can be swapped with intakeServoLeft, although this should be avoided if at all possible. these help move the block up the intake.
<code>Continuous Rotation Servo // intakeServoLeft</code> can be swapped with intakeServoRight, although this should be avoided if at all possible. these help move the block up the intake.
<code>Continuous Rotation Servo // extenderServo</code> this servo is routed through a special servo-powering "board," which is white in color. this is the servo that sits on top of the extendable arm on top of the robot.
<code>Servo // gripperServo</code> this servo is what holds blocks in to the extender.
<code>Servo // capstoneRelease</code> this servo holds the capstone in place until it needs to be released.
<code>Servo // intakePush</code> this servo pushes blocks up the intake system.
