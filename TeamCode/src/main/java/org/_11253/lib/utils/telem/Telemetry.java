/**
 * A high-level abstraction of FTC's telemetry.
 * <p>
 * This utility class contains two different types
 * of telemetry.
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>
 *             <b>Temporary</b>
 *             Temporary telemetry is wiped away every single time
 *             the telemetry data currently stored is printed. This functions
 *             exactly like FTC's default telemetry system - in order for this
 *             to be displayed, it must be assigned a value every single time
 *             telemetry is printed. Temporary telemetry IS accessible. addLine
 *             and addData still return with String keys, which are in the format
 *             of "temp_#." Although I'm not entirely sure for what reason you'd want
 *             to have access to temporary telemetry, it's there anyway.
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             <b>Permanent</b>
 *             Permanent telemetry is NOT wiped away whenever all of the
 *             telemetry data is printed. This is useful for storing values
 *             which you don't want to have to manually update the value of
 *             every single time you want telemetry to be printed. Permanent data
 *             works with a key-based system, meaning you have to use String keys
 *             to refer to or access Permanent telemetry. All of the permanent telemetry
 *             related functions return Strings, which are the keys that you're using.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     I'm sure as you can tell, based on how incredibly
 *     shitty & poorly written this code is, I'm not exactly an
 *     expert with HashMaps just yet, but I hope this will suffice.
 *     I mean, it makes sense to me, so it's okay, right?
 *     I'll probably be the only person who's going to be using
 *     this anyway, so....
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     As a suggestion for a potential use case, this could be used
 *     for debugging purposes. Hypothetically, let's say you need
 *     to determine the last value of EVERY single thing on the entire
 *     controller or something absolutely absurd. Look, I really don't know.
 *     But anyway, you could use the permanent telemetry to display every
 *     value at all times, regardless of what it's current value is.
 *     Which could be nice, or something, honestly, I'm not too sure.
 *     Look, if you're seriously planning on using this library, you're
 *     probably clinically insane enough to be reading this right now
 *     and be understanding every single word of it anyway.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Here's a pretty (not really) cool fact - telemetry only updates every 250ms! FTC, by default, includes a
 *     throttling system to ensure there's not too much traffic between the robot phone and driver phone.
 *     According to the JavaDocs in the RobotController, there's a variable named "msTransmissionInterval." As you could
 *     probably guess, this is the interval (in ms) between telemetry transmissions. Look here!
 *     <code>
 *     "Actual transmission to the driver station is throttled to avoid use of excessive bandwidth. By default,
 *     transmission will occur at most every 250ms. This interval can be controlled with setMsTransmissionInterval().
 *     Any update()s which occur more frequently will not be transmitted if superseded by a subsequent update() before
 *     the transmission interval expires."
 *     </code>
 *     In order to not use up too much processing power, telemetry will (by default) (probably) be limited to only
 *     updating every 125ms (half of the 250ms FTC uses by default, just to ensure we're as updated as we can be
 *     without overdoing it). Of course, this can be changed. I'm not entirely sre why you'd want to change it, but...
 *     oh well.
 * </p>
